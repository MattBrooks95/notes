* wayland-scanner scans the XML files that define Wayland protocols and generates high-level code 
    * `wayland-scanner` generates c
    * `wayland-rs` generates Rust
    * `waymonad-scanner` generates Haskell
* `libwayland` is two libraries, `libwayland-client` and `libwayland-server`
    * they have an implementation of the "wire protocol" for each end of the connection (client and server)
    * provides other utilities for data structures and event loops
    * also contains a pre-compiled copy of the Wayland protocol that was generated by wayland-scanner
